## 🔧 MVP Calculation Algorithm

### Scoring Criteria & Weights:

| Criteria | Weight | Impact | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Team Performance** | 50% | High | Most important factor |
| **Turnovers** | 25% | High | Lower is better |
| **Points** | 15% | Medium | Scoring ability |
| **Rebounds** | 15% | Medium | Rebounding ability |
| **Assists** | 15% | Medium | Playmaking ability |
| **Steals** | 15% | Medium | Defensive impact |
| **Blocks** | 10% | Low | Rim protection |
| **Personal Fouls** | 10% | Low | Lower is better |

### Algorithm Process:
